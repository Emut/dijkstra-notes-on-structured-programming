These notes have the status of ``Letters written to myself'': 
I wrote them down because, without doing so, I found myself 
repeating the same arguments over and over again.
When reading what I had written, I was not always too satisfied.

For one thing, I felt that they suffered from a marked verbosity.
Yet I do not try to condense them (now), firstly because that 
would introduce another delay and I would like to ``think on'', 
secondly because earlier experiences have made me afraid of being 
misunderstood: many a programmer tends to see his (sometimes rather
specific) difficulties as the core of the subject and as a
result there are widely divergent opinions as to what programming 
is really about.

For another thing, as a document this is very incomplete: I am 
only too aware of the fact that it ends in mid-air. Yet I have
decided to have these notes duplicated, besides some practical
considerations mainly to show what I have thought to those who
expressed interest in it or to those whose comments I would
welcome.

I hope that, despite its defects, you will enjoy at least parts
of it. If these notes prove to be a source of inspiration or to
give you a new appreciation of the programmer's trade, some of
my goals will have been reached.
