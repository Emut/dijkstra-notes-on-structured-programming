Was reading it, thought why not digitize it along the way.

Tried to respect the original format as much as possible, while trying
to stay with in the modern typesetting rules.

Plain-text chapters are available under `/chapters`. Kept them as TeX free as possible to enable future reuse.

Will add chapters as I read. Current progress: 1/16
